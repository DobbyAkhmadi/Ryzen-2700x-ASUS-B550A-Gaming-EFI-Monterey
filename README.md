This is the fully detailed guide on how to create a working Hackintosh machine using:

MacOS Monterey 12.1
OpenCore 0.7.9
Processor: AMD Ryzen 3700x
RAM: 16 GB 3200 Mhz
Graphics: NVIDIA GTX 760 2GB DDR5 (should patch using geforce kepler)
SSD: 256 GB SSD
This repository contains also EFI folder with all binaries produced meanwhile. The missing pieces might be however serial numbers or other hardware identifiers.

All parts of the PC work great. What is not working here is caused only by lack of proper hardware.
